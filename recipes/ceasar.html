    <h1>Ceasar Salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My grandfather, Richard, is to thank for this recipe. He is 90 years old and took cooking classes at Sur La Table
        where he learned and fell in love with this caesar salad recipe, so we re-created it at home together.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 French Baguette, cut in half and thinly sliced (1/4" thick)</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Croutons</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F. Cut the baguette in half lengthwise through the top of the baguette then slice
            diagonally into 1/4" thick pieces. Place the breads onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil and 1 tsp of finely minced garlic. Drizzle the garlic
            oil over the croutons and sprinkle the top with 2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer over the baking sheet and bake at 350˚F until light
            golden and crisp (10-12 minutes), or to desired crispness.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Salad Dressing</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, dijon, Worcestershire, lemon juice and red wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>Slowly drizzle in extra virgin olive oil while whisking constantly.</li>
        <li>Whisk in 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or season to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Salad</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse, dry and chop or tear the romaine into bite-sized pieces. Place in a large serving bowl and sprinkle
            generously with shredded parmesan cheese and cooled croutons. Drizzle with caesar dressing and toss gently
            until lettuce is evenly coated.</li>
    </ol>
